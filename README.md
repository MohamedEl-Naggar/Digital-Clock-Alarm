The clock was implemented on the Basys-3 FPGA board and it works as follow: the clock starts as a normal clock calculating displaying minutes and hours. Pressing the center button changes it's mode to setup up the alarm or the clock. When the time reaches the alarm time that was set, the LEDs starts blinking untill the user presses any button.
